### Reflection

I was always a bit hesitant on my ability about CSS, andly luckily on a good day I came accross CSS Battle - A web app where you replicate the target presented. It was fun, interesting and at the same time taught CSS the best way possible - just practicing. I consistently played it everyday and in no time I had immense confidence in CSS, good enough to believe I can achieve anything in CSS.

As an inspiration and out of curiosity on how this worked, I build CSS fight - a clone of CSS battle.
Building this app was quite a different experience. I have spent around 30-40 Hours on this. Helped me explore dynamic position tracking and aspects of image comparison.

### Upcoming Features

- Leader Boards
- Improved Image comparison
